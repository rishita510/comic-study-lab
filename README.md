# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Node.js version

Vite (used by this project) requires a newer Node.js runtime than some older environments provide. Use Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+.

Recommended (non-destructive) approach:

- Install nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then run:

```
nvm install 22.12.0
nvm alias default 22.12.0
nvm use default
```

After that you can run the dev server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you prefer not to use nvm, upgrade Node with your system package manager or Node installer to one of the supported versions above.
